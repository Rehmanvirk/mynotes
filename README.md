# MY NOTES

A website for learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and Databases with detailed notes, code examples, and exercises.

## Overview

This project includes four HTML pages:
- `index.html`: Homepage with links to other sections.
- `oop.html`: Covers OOP concepts (Classes, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Method Overriding, Composition, Association) with JavaScript examples and exercises.
- `dsa.html`: Covers data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps) and algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, Recursion, DFS, BFS, Dynamic Programming) with JavaScript examples and exercises.
- `databases.html`: Covers database concepts (Relational Databases, SQL, NoSQL, Normalization, Transactions, Indexing, Joins, Database Design) with SQL/MongoDB examples and exercises.

## Features
- Detailed notes for all topics.
- JavaScript examples for OOP and DSA; SQL/MongoDB examples for Databases.
- Exercises with solutions for hands-on practice.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Easy navigation with a sticky navbar.

## Setup
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Place `index.html`, `oop.html`, `dsa.html`, and `databases.html` in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage
- Navigate to sections (OOP, DSA, Databases) from the homepage.
